# ðŸ¤– Named-Entity-Recognition-and-Computer-Vision
## ðŸ‘€ Overview
- Task1:
  - Train a named entity recognition (NER) model for the identification of mountain names inside the texts.
- Task2:
  - Algorithm for matching satellite images.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Accurately identifies and classifies mountain names within given texts.

- Utilizes contextual information to distinguish between generic mentions of mountains and specific instances where a name is being referenced.

- Employs advanced feature extraction techniques to compare and match key features in satellite images.

- Utilizes optimized search algorithms for quick and effective matching of satellite images within large datasets.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
